* SRE is basically a sys-admin solving infrastructure problems, like a developer would

* Share the pain, share the gain. 
It is when you need to show the advanced the project, show the risk and 

* You have to embrace risk.
You have to have date, you have to plan, you have to have fallback, revert procedure.

* Making gradual changes
You don't to try to tackle everything everywhere, focus on the topic, iterate over it and so on and so on
